# JavaScript Practice Project

This repository contains a collection of small exercises designed to practice core JavaScript concepts in the browser environment.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build, test, and reinforce fundamental JavaScript skills such as:

- Working with DOM elements
- Handling events
- Using functions and callbacks
- Control structures (loops, conditionals, etc.)

Each exercise is contained within its own JS file, and linked to its own HTML for clarity and modularity.

## 🎨 Styling

Due to time constraints, only the **first exercise** was minimally styled using **SCSS**
and **Bootstrap**. The rest of the exercises remain functional but unstyled to prioritize functionality over presentation.
All of the tasks are demonstrated and can be checked out through the console.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for logic and interactivity
- **SCSS** for modular and maintainable styling (first exercise only)
